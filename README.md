Classify handwritten digits

My first attempt to implement the 'hello world' of Artificial Neural Networks from scratch... in JavaScript ( ⚆ _ ⚆ ).

This is a simple neural net trained on the [MNIST database](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) to classify images of handwritten digits.

Do not try this at home, you are better off working in Python or Octave.

### Dependencies
